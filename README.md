# Graph Neural Network Project

This project implements the Enhanced Graph Attention Network(EGAT) with Node Feature Augmentation and  Adaptive Attention using PyTorch Geometric (PyG) for node classification tasks.

## Usage

1. **Setup Environment**: Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
2. **Run the Main Script**: Execute `scripts/run_main.py` to train and evaluate the model.
3. **To perform grid search**: Execute `scripts/grid_search.py` to perform grid search for hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains source code for models and utilities.
- `data/`: Directory for storing datasets.
- `figures/`: Contains figures generated during training.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
